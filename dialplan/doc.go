// Package dialplan facilitates the programmatic creation of asterisk
// dialplans.
//
// The asterisk documentation overloads the term "expression" with various
// meanings. In this package an "expression" is any dialplan code that can
// be evaluated to produce a result. This package uses the term "operation"
// to describe expressions that involve an operator.
